## About our users

The following list is meant to give a general overview of the kind of 
users we have.

#### The regular one

These are people that want to be well informed and usually fact-check 
articles with others. For them, _faux_ is an opportunity to get part 
of this job done.

#### The big one

These are companies, mostly social network platforms, that want to 
include new functionality in their product. Precisely, the ability 
to flag potentially fake or hazardous content for their users.

#### The involved-with-the-cause one

These are the many organizations that try to dismantle unproven and
pseudoscientific health recommendations in favor of evidence-based 
information. There're two ways we can benefit from each other here:

- By providing a tool meant to flag this type of content.
- By receiving new heuristics to help us better detect harmful information.
