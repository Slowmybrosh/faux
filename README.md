# Faux

Faux is a tool aimed to reduce misinformation along the web.

It analyzes texts and headlines to categorize them as fake news, 
clickbait articles or seemingly-normal-things. On top of that, 
it provides information about how likely this prediction is based 
on its source and topic (health, economics, etc).

### Why and how

We've lately seen an increase in misleading information presented 
as true in the media. This project seeks an easy-access to 
reliable news and sources for everyone, no matter their previous 
knowledge or background.

Faux takes news and headlines as input and applies heuristics to 
classify them. Being a cloud service, it's constantly being 
updated and refined to achieve the best possible outcome.
