# Faux
Faux is a tool aimed to reduce misinformation along the web.

It analyzes texts and headlines to categorize them as fake news, clickbait articles or semingly-normal-things. On top of that, it provides information about how likely this prediction is based on its source and topic (health, economics, etc).


### Why Faux
We've lately seen an increase in misleading information presented as true in the media. This project seeks an easy-access to reliable news and sources for everyone, no matter their previous knowledge or background.
